This is based on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Course. I got accustomed to basics of Flutter and Dart and the concept behind widgets.
After making this app, I also got an overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones.
This app uses:
* [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang)
* [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)
